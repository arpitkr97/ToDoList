# ToDoList

TodoList is a web application designed to help users manage their tasks and stay organized. It provides a convenient and user-friendly interface for creating, tracking, and updating tasks in a list format. With TodoList, users can easily keep track of their to-dos, set deadlines, prioritize tasks, and mark tasks as completed.

TodoList is typically built using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end user interface, and server-side technologies like PHP, Python, Ruby, or Node.js for the backend functionality. It may also involve integration with databases such as MySQL, MongoDB, or other data storage solutions to store and retrieve task data.
